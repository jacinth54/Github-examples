## Cloning

### SSH

```
git clone SSH address in Code
cd GitHub-Examples
```

We will need to creat our own SSH rsa key pair

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

We can test our connection here:
```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

For WSL users and if you create a non default key you might need to add it.

Have to look into how to change account via terminal
